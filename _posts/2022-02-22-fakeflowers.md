                            It does not matter if ones interaction with cacti is just recognising them as spiky plants that more than likely will hurt you with the slightest touch or one is seasoned cacti collector, you've definitely seen Echinocactus Grusonii at some point. 
                            It is not a surprise – this cactus has been known to us for over 130 years. This massive specimen was an instant attraction in cactus world. Big, spiny and not that hard to look after, it grows from 20cm to 130cm in diameter and can reach up to 1m in height.

                            In more southern countries, this cactus makes a perfect landscaping plant. In countries like Spain, Greece, Portugal these cacti can be seen as a beautiful garden piece. 
                            Surprisingly enough even in our climate we do have growers who are growing them outside all year round. Kevin Begley got his
                            E. Grusonii few years back in Cornwall and is now growing it in xeric bed with a top covering. 
                            His grusonii seems to be doing great, given how unforgiving Irish climate can get.
